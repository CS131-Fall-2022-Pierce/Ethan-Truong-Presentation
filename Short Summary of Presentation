This project was to briefly go over the basics of a matrix, its application of matrices, and its real-life applications. 
 I presented the following: 
 definition of a matrix, 
 matrix addition, 
 matrix multiplication, 
 transpose of a matrix, 
 and briefly went over how to find the inverse of a matrix and their real-life application in specific fields.
